\# Problem Statement



Current cybersecurity defenses assume that threats can be anticipated, labeled, and

classified in advance. This assumption fails against adaptive adversaries who deliberately

change tactics to bypass detection mechanisms.



Signature-based systems fail against novel attacks.

Machine learning systems fail when trained data becomes obsolete.

Rule-based automation fails when attacker intent is ambiguous.



The core problem is that modern cyber defense systems do not adapt autonomously.

They require continuous human updates, expert tuning, and manual policy redesign.



This research addresses the following problem:



How can a cyber defense system autonomously evolve its defensive strategies in response

to unknown and adaptive adversaries without relying on predefined rules, signatures,

or labeled datasets?
