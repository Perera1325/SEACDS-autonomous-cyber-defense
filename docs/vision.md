\# Vision



Modern cybersecurity systems are fundamentally reactive, static, and human-dependent.

They rely on predefined rules, signatures, or trained models that fail when attackers

adapt, mutate, or invent new strategies.



This project proposes a paradigm shift:

Cybersecurity systems should evolve like living organisms.



The vision of SEACDS (Self-Evolving Autonomous Cyber Defense System) is to create a

fully autonomous defense mechanism capable of observing attacker behavior, inferring

intent, generating new defensive strategies, validating them in isolation, and deploying

them without human intervention.



The system treats defensive logic as evolvable genetic material rather than fixed rules.

Over time, ineffective defenses die out, while successful ones survive, mutate, and improve.



This work aims to eliminate the human-in-the-loop dependency that currently limits

cyber defense scalability, speed, and resilience.
