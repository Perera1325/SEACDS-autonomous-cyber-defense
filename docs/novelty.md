\# Research Novelty



This project introduces several novel contributions to the field of cybersecurity:



1\. Defense as Genetic Material  

&nbsp;  Defensive logic is represented as evolvable genomes rather than static rules.



2\. Autonomous Policy Evolution  

&nbsp;  Defensive strategies are generated, mutated, and selected automatically without

&nbsp;  human-authored policies.



3\. Intent-Centric Threat Modeling  

&nbsp;  The system infers attacker intent rather than classifying known attack patterns.



4\. Survival-Based Defense Selection  

&nbsp;  Defensive strategies are evaluated based on real-time effectiveness, false positives,

&nbsp;  and system impact, allowing only the most effective defenses to persist.



5\. Continuous Co-Evolution  

&nbsp;  The system evolves in response to attacker adaptation, creating an ongoing arms race

&nbsp;  between attacker behavior and defensive evolution.



To the best of our knowledge, no existing cybersecurity system fully integrates autonomous

evolution, intent inference, and live defensive mutation into a single operational framework.
