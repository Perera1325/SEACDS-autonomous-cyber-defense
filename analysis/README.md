\# Behavior Analysis \& Intent Signals



This module transforms raw system and network telemetry into

structured behavioral intent signals.



Instead of classifying known attacks, the system identifies

behavioral indicators such as:

\- connection bursts

\- communication with multiple remote hosts



These intent signals will later drive autonomous defense evolution.
