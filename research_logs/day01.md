\# Day 01 Research Log



Date: Day 01



Focus:

\- Defining the research vision

\- Identifying the core cybersecurity problem

\- Establishing project novelty



Key Insights:

\- Most cybersecurity systems fail due to static assumptions.

\- Human-in-the-loop security does not scale against adaptive attackers.

\- Evolutionary principles provide a promising framework for autonomous defense.



Decisions Made:

\- Defense logic will be treated as genetic material.

\- The system will not rely on labeled datasets.

\- Adaptation must occur without human approval.



Next Steps:

\- Formalize the Defense DNA structure.

\- Define what constitutes a "defense genome".
