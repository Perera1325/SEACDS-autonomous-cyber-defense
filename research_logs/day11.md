\# Day 11 Research Log



Focus:

\- Baseline comparison against static defense



Work Done:

\- Implemented non-evolving defense baseline

\- Compared static and evolving defenses under identical conditions



Insights:

\- Static defenses show limited effectiveness

\- Self-evolving defenses achieve higher cumulative fitness



Conclusion:

\- Autonomous evolution provides measurable security advantages



Next Steps:

\- Finalize research paper structure

\- Prepare results and figures for submission
