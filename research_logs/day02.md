\# Day 02 Research Log



Focus:

\- Implementing the Defense DNA structure



Work Done:

\- Created DefenseGenome class

\- Defined mutation logic

\- Implemented initial fitness function



Insights:

\- Defensive logic can be abstracted into evolvable components.

\- Fitness evaluation must balance security and system cost.



Next Steps:

\- Create a population of genomes

\- Implement selection and reproduction
