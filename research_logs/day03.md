\# Day 03 Research Log



Focus:

\- Implementing population-based defense evolution



Work Done:

\- Created defense populations

\- Implemented fitness-based selection

\- Enabled autonomous reproduction with mutation

\- Built a full evolution cycle simulator



Insights:

\- Even simple fitness functions create meaningful diversity.

\- Evolution removes ineffective defenses without manual intervention.



Next Steps:

\- Replace random attack simulation with real behavioral data.

\- Connect evolution engine to live sensors.
